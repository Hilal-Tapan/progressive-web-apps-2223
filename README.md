Your daily web quote was a browser based one page web project, designed to view quotes related to the web. 
Whether you are a ux designer or a back-end developer, it doesn't matter. The quotes can apply to all jobs in the web field! 

For the progressive web app course, I'm going to refate my Your Daily Web quotes app to a server side application using Node.js. This project is part of the minor Web Design and Development at the University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam.

## üíª Installation üíª

#### install nvm
1. To install the server you need node and express. You can do that with nvm. Nvm is package installer where you can install different packages. With this code you can install the latest versions of npm and node:
```
nvm install 19.8.1
```

#### Clone repo
2. Clone this repository by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hilal-Tapan/progressive-web-apps-2223.git
```

#### NPM install
3. Install the dependencies by running 
```
npm install 
```
to install the dependencies. 

#### Start server
4. Then run 
```
npm start
```
 to start the development server.


## üíæ Node.js server üíæ
1. Install Node.js: First, you need to install Node.js on your computer. You can download and install it from the official website.

2. Create a new project: Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the command line interface.

3. Initialize the project: In the project directory, use the command npm init to initialize the project. This will create a package.json file, which contains information about your project.

4. Install Express: Express is a popular Node.js framework that makes it easy to create web applications. Install it using the command npm install express.

5. Create a server file: Create a new file in your project directory called server.js. This file will contain the code for your server.

6. Import Express: In server.js, import Express using the following code:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
```

7. Create a route: A route is a function that is executed when a user accesses a specific URL. Create a route using the following code:
```javascript
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});
```
This code creates a route that responds with the text "Hello World!" when a user accesses the root URL.

8. Start the server: Finally, start the server using the following code:
```javascript
app.listen(3000, function() {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```
This code starts the server on port 3000 and logs a message to the console.

## üìÅ Template engine üìÅ

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating engine for Node.js that allows you to embed JavaScript code inside HTML templates to generate dynamic content on the server-side. 

#### Here are the basic steps to using EJS:
1. Install EJS: First, you need to install EJS in your Node.js project using the npm package manager. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install ejs
```

2. Create an EJS template: After installing EJS, you need to create an EJS template file. An EJS template file has a ".ejs" file extension and contains HTML markup with embedded JavaScript code. You can use EJS syntax to inject dynamic data into your HTML markup.

3. Render the EJS template: To render an EJS template, you need to use the ejs.render() method. This method takes two arguments: the path to the EJS template file and an object containing the data you want to inject into the template. Here's an example of how to render an EJS template:
```javascript
const ejs = require('ejs');
const data = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
ejs.renderFile('template.ejs', data, function(err, html) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(html);
});
```
In this example, we're rendering a template file called "template.ejs" and injecting an object with two properties (name and age) into the template.

4.  Use EJS syntax: In your EJS template file, you can use EJS syntax to inject dynamic data and execute JavaScript code. Here are some examples of EJS syntax:

* ``` <%= variable %> - inject a variable into the HTML markup ```
* ``` <% if (condition) { %> ... <% } %> - execute JavaScript code based on a condition```
* ``` <% for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) { %> ... <% } %> - iterate over an array and execute JavaScript code```

## API 
The fetching of the api had to be changed a little bit. For this I used AXIOS in stead of REQUEST. This is because request was not working well with this so that is why I used Axios. 

``` javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    let data;
    axios.get('https://opensheet.elk.sh/12nr4W-RHpvhnw76MCZZtujYHqP1qIU28ExM4oXQfzys/blad1')
        .then((response) => {
            console.log('result', response.data)
            data = response.data
            res.render('index', {
                title: 'Home',
                data: data
            });

        }).catch((error) => {
            console.log('error', error)
        })
})
```
This is a code snippet that defines a route for an HTTP GET request in a Node.js web application using the Express framework. The route is defined using the app.get() method of an Express application object (app).
The route's path is set to '/', which means that it will handle requests to the application's root URL.
The route handler function takes two parameters: req (request) and res (response).
Within the function, a variable data is declared and assigned to undefined.
Then, an HTTP GET request is sent to the URL 'https://opensheet.elk.sh/12nr4W-RHpvhnw76MCZZtujYHqP1qIU28ExM4oXQfzys/blad1' using the Axios library. Axios is a popular library for making HTTP requests in Node.js applications.
If the request is successful, the response data is logged to the console and assigned to the data variable. Then, the res.render() method is called to render the 'index' view with a title of 'Home' and the data variable passed as an object. This view will be displayed in the user's browser as the response to the HTTP request.
If the request fails, an error message is logged to the console.
Overall, this code retrieves data from an external source and passes it to a view to be rendered as a webpage in response to an HTTP GET request.

```javascript 
app.get('/quotes/:id', (req, res) => {
    let data;
    axios.get('https://opensheet.elk.sh/12nr4W-RHpvhnw76MCZZtujYHqP1qIU28ExM4oXQfzys/blad1')
      .then((response) => {
        console.log('result', response.data);
        data = response.data;
        const filteredQuotes = data.filter(quote => quote.id === req.params.id); // filter the quotes based on the id parameter
        res.render('quotes', {
          title: 'Random Quote',
          data: filteredQuotes // render only the filtered quotes
        });
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log('error', error);
      });
  }); 
```
Here i used data.filter to filter the quote.id with req.params.id and render these.

## Description
In this course we convert the client side web application, made during the Web App From Scratch course, into a server side rendered application. We also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Finally we‚Äôll implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application.
